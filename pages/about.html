                Strange for me to be creating a Developer Portfolio when in fact I am not a developer. Yet. Over the last two years I have taken up coding as a hobby. I have done several courses on the Coursera platform, most notably a Python Specialisation which culminated
                in a Capstone project. Building on my knowledge of Python, I built a
                <a href="https://alexdjangoblogapp.herokuapp.com/">Blog Application</a
          >
          using the Django framework, by following a YouTube tutorial. Another
          hobby I am passionate about, and spend a lot of resources on, is
          learning to speak Polish. The Django blog application came in handy as
          a tool for learning Polish; I use it as a notebook I can access on my
          phone. I also did a few courses on the Udemy platform, mostly HTML,
          Sass-CSS and JavaScript. It is really great following tutorials, but
          itâ€™s a bit like paint by numbers. You are following someone who has
          some mastery over their art. You are not witness to the sweat and
          tears it took to become proficient. You are witnessing the finished
          product. That is what brings me to Boolean. A willingness to commit
          and work hard, so I too can become a master of this fine art. Coding.

        <h3>Industrial Chemist</h3>
        <p>
          What has Industrial Chemistry got to do with coding. Well, everything
          and nothing. After leaving High School I studied Industrial Chemistry
          for five years. Are the skills acquired as an Industrial Chemist
          transferable into the world of coding. I worked as an Industrial
          Chemist for 12 years, and yes, the skills acquired are transferrable
          to, life in general, and the discipline of coding.

            <h3>Tibetan Buddhist Monk</h3>
            <p>
                12 years of Industrial Chemistry was enough for 1 life-time. Time for a radical change. In 2003 I came to the UK to participate in a four-year-cloistered meditation retreat held by Samye Ling Monastery in Eskdalemuir, Scotland. I studied Tibetan Buddhist
                Meditation under some very accomplished Tibetan Masters. One four-year retreat was not enough, so after a years break I applied for a Contemplative Scholarship through the Tsadra Foundation, which I was granted, and entered and completed
                a second four-year-cloistered retreat. On leaving the retreat I met my partner, who happens to be Polish, hence my interest in learning the Polish Language.

            <h3>Complex Clinical Care</h3>
            <p>
                After giving back my vows of ordination, in favour of a life with Anna, I decided to become a care worker, which I have done for 8 years. All the life experience I have, from the laboratory to the monastery, all come to bare when I work as a live-in carer,
                caring for people with spinal injury. It was while I was working as a live-in carer that I had the spare time to learn Polish and coding. That brings me to my next iteration and Boolean.
